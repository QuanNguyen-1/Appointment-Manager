# Appointment-Manager
This is a web application that can manage appointments using HTML, CSS, Php, MySQL, and Bootstrap. From the main page, the user can choose to input a new appointment or search for an already exisiting appointment. When inputing a new appointment, information about the customer name, phone number, appointment date, and appointment time will be needed. The information will then be stored into the MySQL database. When searching for an appointment, the user can choose to search by customer name, appointment date, or appointments today. For the name and date options, the user will need to input the name or date information and the application will return the appointments matching the specified input from the database and put it into a table that the user can see. For the today option, it will show the current day of the week and the date. Pressing search will return a table with the appointments that should occur that current day. The user will also be able to delete results they see in the table. If there are no appointments that match the specified search terms, the application will have a message showing 0 results.
